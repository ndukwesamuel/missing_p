          Missingperson.com.ng provide a platform where the public can
          upload missing people and also check regularly to take note of
          faces incase they come across any.This platform has been created
          to help tackle the issue of missing people in the nation. This is
          a serious situation in which the crushing effect can have a long
          lasting damaging effect on any family.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          For this reason, we want our users to be responsible enough to
          know the delicate nature of their actions by not just posting out
          of panick or to prank but to post only real cases of missing
          people.
        </p>

          Many children have been traded and uploading them here can help
          reunite them to their parents. We are not promising that we will
          find any missing person but our platform is a hub which makes it
          easier for a wider reach and a higher chance of sombody coming
          across any known face.
